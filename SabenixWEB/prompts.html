									<h3>Prompt 1</h3>
									<p>In many art forms, there can be a wide variety of tools that can allow the artist to move forward in their practices whether it is tangible or intangible. In my art practices most notably on film, their can be a wide selection of elements that can contribute to the form and content. For the physical materials there’s the camera that allows the recording of a wide range of perspectives and document an essence of time. Moreover, theirs also secondary devices that can be considered attachments of the device’s body that intertwine with the path of the final product, such as a microphone, a tripod and more. For the nonphysical elements, the usage of editing which allows the ability to control time and space. The agglomeration of these elements can attach the viewer emotionally and diverts people’s expectations. Although these concepts contribute to the creation process, my own mind of expression is the main factor that compile the technical to make the idea. The represented image of scene that consist of characters, landscapes, objects, and lighting can be seen as tools for the mise-en-scene that can follow the theme’s semiotics or foreshadows the plot.									</p>

										With 1.14 million subscribers as of this writing, Jin Lim, commonly known as JinnyboyTV, is a Malaysian video creator on YouTube. Lim manages to create compelling narratives and utilizes social media to promote his up coming projects to his audiences. In his practice, the artist attempts to focus on a variety of genres such as short films, animations, and commercials. In 2020, they were able to build the company “Aspect:Ratio”, as they state:<cite><a href="https://www.aspectratiostudios.com/why-aspect-ratio/ ">“Consuming content in different aspect ratios influences our experience as a consumer (whether subliminally or explicitly) – and that is why we’re here to help brands achieve that”</a></cite>, as they experiment with various forms of content. Additionally, they do take priority into the importance of their culture. 
										For instance, in their film,<cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgf-vWuGQXc&t=334s"> “The Girl That Changed Me”</a></cite> , the film’s locations, space and cast members, are linked together to give extra information about their backgrounds which enhances the experience for the audience.

									<h3>Prompt 3.1</h3>

										Throughout my development, I have worn a wide range of masks of many assortments from my public, private and virtual identity. There are occurrences where I wonder to myself if I landed into the correct timeline while my mind wanders through diverse types of media and possibilities. After many internal evaluations and observations from different angles, many of my methodologies and engagement can often be intertwined in the making of projects from its content and form. Within my personal growth, my origins feel alienated and distant as I’ve never been well introduced to its culture adequately by my family members nor peers. Furthermore, my desire to pursue the arts and self-expression isn’t a well-received notion for my parents, as they continue to reinforce social expectations and norms. Despite our bond, allowing their social attitudes 
										to fester hinders personal growth, isolates different perspectives, and encourages the youth to repeat previous discriminatory mistakes and to view the world in a signal outcome. However, in my physical and virtual body to perform and create, it grants the ability to experiment with various media, cultures, and identities from its tangible and intangible form that engages the viewer. Despite working to obtain a selected degree at an institution, the desire to create keeps getting intertwined rather than divided.

									<p>Dear Megan Lee,
									thank you for giving me the inspiration to engage in the realm of the arts and to spread positivity. Ever since your television sitcom, “Make It Pop” aired in 2015, your portrayal of the character Sun Hi, intrigued my ears from your amazing voice! After doing some research, it surprised me to found out that your re-enactment of the next self-proclaimed super star influencer had similarities into your own reality as a content creator on social media. The music you’ve composed and covered on pop and folk music, kept fascinating me from its content and production, as they would always outdo themselves. I’ve always enjoyed your music and acting performances, since it would instantly lift my spirits every time I would feel down or in search for inspiration. After hearing about your recent condition with spasmodic and muscle tension dysphonia,
									from your song “Sing” that was released on August 3rd, 2022, it was truly a heartbreaking moment for me to hear that you wouldn’t be able to sing in anytime soon. This self-reflective piece truly illustrated your own identity with music from its composition and visuals. However, despite this set back you continue to shine in on various projects and engage with your community. Hopefully one day, I’ll be able to meet you since you are a great inspiration in my eyes.
									<p>Thank you!</p>
									<p>Yanh Le</p>

										<p>According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a manifesto is a written statement that publicly declares one’s intentions, motives, or views it’s from its issuer.</p>
										Ever since April 14, 2014, I have decided to push myself to get out of my comfort zone by creating the identity of SaberPhoenix to participate in social platforms, incorporate my creativity to bring new ideas in content creation, examine its analytics and distribute projects to an audience with similar interest for entertainment purposes. With a fan-base of around 19,800 subscribers named The Sabenix Army, these productions compose of films, animations, photography, performance art and design with topics that catered to my interests. From the engagement and participation of my created community, I have the possibility to interact with people from different backgrounds, create new connections and unite them to enrich my own critical thinking. According to my point of view, if you innovate, experiment, research, and cultivate your interests, you will be able to acquire new skills,
										enrich your practice, and develop a better understanding on how you want to represent yourself to an audience. For instance, despite my main pursuit is in the topic of video creation, I was able to connect many of my talents into a singular container, get a better understanding of technology, and extent my method of development. By focusing on a particular platform and create a fixed schedule to consistently upload one to three videos while still prioritizing the quality of the production, it allowed an opening to gradually grow my identity and works.

										<div> <p>In conclusion, given my analytics from the last 60 days, this project gave me the challenge to keep a constant upload schedule while simultaneously prioritising the quality of my content. 
											From my determination to find success with the goal to practice self-confidence in a public space, my work ethic slowly became a routine and a source to learn new skills.
